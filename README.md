What is Rights alert?
---------------------

Rights alert is an application for Android devices version 2.2 (Froyo) and higher.
It has been developped on a 4.0 (Ice Cream Device) phone and has been tested on a 2.2 phone and a 4.0 tablet.

The purpose of Rights alert is to display a list of installed applications that requires a lot of permissions.
The principle is simple: each permission represent an amount of points, and if the sum of points exceed a score, the application is considered as dangerous.
